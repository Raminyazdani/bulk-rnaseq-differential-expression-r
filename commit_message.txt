Implement core differential expression analysis using DESeq2 with comprehensive statistical 
testing, multiple significance thresholds, and gene annotation. This commit represents the 
primary analytical engine of the pipeline, identifying genes differentially expressed between 
dexamethasone-treated and untreated samples.

DESeq2 analysis workflow:
- Created DESeqDataSet object from count matrix and sample metadata
- Applied design formula: ~dexamethasone (comparing treated vs untreated)
- Pre-filtered low-count genes (genes with <3 counts removed) to improve statistical power
- Ran DESeq() for normalization and differential expression testing
- Generated results at two significance thresholds:
  * α = 0.05 (standard threshold, broader gene set)
  * α = 0.001 (stringent threshold, highest confidence genes)

Gene annotation:
- Implemented ens_to_gene() helper function for batch ID conversion
- Mapped Ensembl gene IDs to HGNC gene symbols using org.Hs.eg.db
- Annotated top 10 differentially expressed genes at each significance level
- Provides human-readable gene names for biological interpretation

Visualizations:
- Generated MA plots showing log2 fold change vs mean expression
- Created plots at three levels: all genes, α=0.05 significant, α=0.001 significant
- MA plots help identify expression patterns and assess analysis quality

Statistical methods:
- Negative binomial generalized linear model for count data
- Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction for multiple testing
- Size factor normalization to account for sequencing depth differences

This analysis identifies the transcriptional response to dexamethasone treatment, providing 
the foundation for downstream pathway enrichment and biological interpretation.

Verified by: Reviewing result counts at each threshold, inspecting top genes, and confirming 
MA plot patterns match expected differential expression characteristics.
