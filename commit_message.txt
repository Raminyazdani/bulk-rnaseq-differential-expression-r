Ramin Yazdani | bulk-rnaseq-differential-expression-r | main | feat(quality): Final quality improvements and hardcoded value fixes

Final completion pass to ensure production readiness by fixing hardcoded gene indices 
in the correlation analysis section. This commit addresses a code robustness issue where 
gene expression values were extracted using hardcoded row indices instead of gene 
identifiers, making the code brittle and dependent on specific data ordering.

Bug fix - Hardcoded indices replaced with dynamic lookup:
- Previously: Used hardcoded indices 8521 and 8082 to extract SPARCL1 and STOM expression
- Now: Dynamically finds Ensembl IDs by looking up gene symbols using org.Hs.eg.db
- Implementation: Uses ens_to_gene() to map gene symbols to Ensembl IDs, then extracts 
  by ID rather than positional index

Why this matters:
- Hardcoded indices break if data filtering changes (e.g., different pre-filtering threshold)
- Gene positions in the matrix can vary across different data processing runs
- Using gene identifiers makes the code self-documenting and maintainable
- Follows bioinformatics best practices for reproducible research

Technical implementation:
```r
# Old approach (brittle):
gene1_counts <- assay(rld)[8521, ]  # Assumes SPARCL1 is at position 8521

# New approach (robust):
gene1_ensembl <- names(which(ens_to_gene(rownames(dex)) == gene1_symbol))[1]
gene1_counts <- assay(rld)[gene1_ensembl, ]  # Looks up by ID
```

This change ensures:
- Code works correctly regardless of data ordering
- Clear intent - gene symbols explicitly stated
- Maintainability - future developers understand gene selection
- Reproducibility - results consistent across different R sessions and filtering parameters

Updated plot labels to use gene1_symbol and gene2_symbol variables for consistency.

Environment constraints:
- R runtime not available in CI environment (expected limitation)
- Changes verified through static code review and logic inspection
- Code structure validated against R best practices
- No breaking changes to API or expected outputs

This represents the final quality pass for portfolio readiness, ensuring the codebase 
follows professional bioinformatics standards and is robust for various use cases.

Verified by: Static code review, comparison with previous version, and validation that 
gene lookup logic matches Bioconductor best practices for identifier management.
