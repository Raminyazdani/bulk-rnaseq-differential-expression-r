Ramin Yazdani | bulk-rnaseq-differential-expression-r | main | feat(complete): Fix database names and complete analysis pipeline

Fix enrichR database name error and complete the full analysis pipeline with comprehensive 
pathway enrichment, quality control visualizations, heatmaps, correlation analysis, and 
portfolio-grade documentation. This commit resolves the database name issue from step_07 
and delivers a complete, production-ready bioinformatics pipeline.

Bug fix:
- Corrected enrichR database name: "KEGG_2020_Human" → "KEGG_2021_Human"
- This resolves the API compatibility issue preventing enrichment queries

Pathway enrichment enhancements:
- Expanded to 9 comprehensive biological databases:
  * KEGG_2021_Human (metabolic pathways)
  * Reactome_2022 (biological pathways)
  * GO_Biological_Process_2023 (biological processes)
  * GO_Molecular_Function_2023 (molecular functions)
  * GO_Cellular_Component_2023 (cellular locations)
  * OMIM_Disease (genetic disease associations)
  * OMIM_Expanded (broader disease context)
  * DisGeNET (gene-disease associations)
  * Human_Phenotype_Ontology (phenotype associations)
- Multi-database approach provides comprehensive biological interpretation
- Results include pathways, diseases, and ontologies for differentially expressed genes

Visualizations added:
1. Boxplots - Expression distribution across samples (quality control)
2. Barplots - Mean expression levels by sample (quality control)
3. Heatmaps (2 versions) - Top 10 DEGs with hierarchical clustering at both significance 
   thresholds (α=0.05 and α=0.001)
4. Scatter plots - Gene-gene correlation analysis (SPARCL1 vs STOM)
5. MA plots - Already implemented in step_06

Statistical methods for visualization:
- rlog transformation for variance stabilization
- Pearson correlation for gene-gene relationships
- Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage for heatmaps

Documentation enhancements:
- Upgraded README to portfolio-grade quality with:
  * Professional badges (R version, Bioconductor, DESeq2)
  * Comprehensive overview and problem statement
  * Detailed tech stack description
  * Clear repository structure diagram
  * Step-by-step setup and installation instructions
  * Multiple run options (RStudio, R console, command line)
  * Complete data and outputs documentation
  * Reproducibility notes and methodology details
  * Troubleshooting table for common issues
  * Performance considerations
  * Extension ideas for future development
- Created project_identity.md with professional project metadata
- Added bulkRNA_project.docx for additional documentation
- Included .github/copilot-instructions.md for AI-assisted development

This commit transforms the project from working code to a portfolio-ready showcase 
demonstrating:
- Bioinformatics expertise (RNA-seq, DESeq2, pathway enrichment)
- R programming proficiency (Bioconductor, tidyverse, visualization)
- Statistical rigor (multiple testing correction, significance thresholds)
- Debugging skills (identified and fixed database version issue)
- Best practices (documentation, reproducibility, project structure)
- Communication ability (clear documentation, visual results)

The pipeline now provides end-to-end analysis from raw count data to biological insights, 
suitable for academic, industry, or collaborative research applications.

Verified by: Running complete pipeline with all packages installed, confirming all 
visualizations generate correctly, enrichment queries return results, and documentation 
accurately reflects implementation.
