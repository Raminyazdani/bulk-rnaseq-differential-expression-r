Ramin Yazdani | bulk-rnaseq-differential-expression-r | main | feat(structure): Add RStudio project structure

Implement RStudio project structure by creating the analysis/ directory and corresponding 
.Rproj file. This organizational change separates analysis code from documentation, 
following R community best practices for project organization.

The analysis.Rproj file enables RStudio-specific features including:
- Automatic working directory management
- Project-scoped settings and history
- Integrated package management
- Seamless navigation between source files

This structure makes the project more accessible to R developers who commonly use RStudio 
as their primary IDE. The separation of concerns (documentation in root, code in analysis/) 
improves project maintainability and clarity.

Updated README to reflect the new project structure with clear directory organization.

Verified by: Opening the project in RStudio and confirming proper project initialization 
and directory context.
