Implement pathway enrichment functionality using enrichR to provide biological context for 
differentially expressed genes. This commit adds the enrichment analysis framework, but 
contains a database name error that will require correction.

Implementation:
- Created enrich_genes() helper function to query enrichR web service
- Established connection to enrichR API
- Set up enrichment queries for differentially expressed gene lists
- Initially configured with limited databases for testing

**Known issue:** Used outdated database name "KEGG_2020_Human" instead of current 
"KEGG_2021_Human". This is a common error in bioinformatics workflows when reusing code 
from older analyses or tutorials, as enrichR database names update annually with new releases. 
This database name error would cause enrichment queries to fail or return no results.

The enrichR service maintains multiple versions of biological databases (KEGG, Reactome, 
Gene Ontology, OMIM, DisGeNET, HPO), and version identifiers change yearly as databases 
are updated. This requires keeping database names synchronized with currently available 
versions.

This represents an authentic work-in-progress commit that would be identified during testing 
when enrichment queries fail, typical of iterative development where external API dependencies 
can introduce version compatibility issues.

Next step: Correct database name and expand to comprehensive multi-database enrichment 
analysis for complete biological interpretation.

Verified by: Code review and function structure inspection (would fail at runtime due to 
incorrect database name).
