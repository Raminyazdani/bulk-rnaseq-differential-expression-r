Ramin Yazdani | bulk-rnaseq-differential-expression-r | main | feat(deps): Implement install_if_missing helper function

Add install_if_missing() helper function to automate package installation and improve 
reproducibility. This function intelligently handles packages from both CRAN and 
Bioconductor repositories with automatic fallback logic, reducing setup friction for 
new users.

Implementation details:
- Checks for BiocManager availability and installs if missing
- Uses requireNamespace() to detect missing packages
- Attempts CRAN installation first with install.packages()
- Falls back to Bioconductor with BiocManager::install() if CRAN fails
- Includes tryCatch() error handling for robust operation
- Automatically loads packages after successful installation

The function is intentionally commented out in the main workflow (lines 40-41) to prevent 
automatic installation on every run, giving users control over package management. This 
is a safety best practice for reproducible research scripts.

This enhancement makes the project more accessible to collaborators and reviewers who 
may not have all dependencies installed, while maintaining the transparency of clearly 
listing all required packages.

Verified by: Testing the function with a mix of installed and missing packages to confirm 
proper CRAN→Bioconductor fallback behavior.
