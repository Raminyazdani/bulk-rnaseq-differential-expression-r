Ramin Yazdani | bulk-rnaseq-differential-expression-r | main | feat(init): Initial repository setup

Initialize the bulk RNA-seq differential expression analysis project with foundational 
repository structure. This commit establishes the basic project organization with a 
descriptive README outlining the project vision for differential expression analysis 
using DESeq2 and pathway enrichment. The .gitignore file ensures R-specific artifacts 
(.RData, .Rhistory, .Rproj.user) are excluded from version control, maintaining a 
clean repository.

The project aims to provide a reproducible R-based pipeline for bulk RNA-seq analysis, 
featuring DESeq2 normalization, statistical testing, and comprehensive visualization of 
gene expression patterns.

This initial setup provides the foundation for a professional bioinformatics portfolio 
project demonstrating expertise in RNA-seq analysis, R programming, and reproducible 
research practices.

Verified by: Reviewing file structure and ensuring .gitignore patterns are appropriate 
for R projects.
