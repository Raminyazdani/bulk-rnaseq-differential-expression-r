Ramin Yazdani | bulk-rnaseq-differential-expression-r | main | feat(deps): Add required packages and loading logic

Create main.R analysis script with comprehensive package dependencies for bulk RNA-seq 
differential expression analysis. This commit establishes all required packages from both 
CRAN and Bioconductor repositories, including DESeq2 (differential expression), airway 
(example dataset), enrichR (pathway enrichment), pheatmap (heatmaps), org.Hs.eg.db (gene 
annotation), and supporting packages for data manipulation and visualization.

The package list includes:
- Bioconductor packages: DESeq2, airway, org.Hs.eg.db
- CRAN packages: GEOquery, Seurat, dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2, patchwork, enrichR, pheatmap

Implemented a simple loading loop using library(pkg, character.only = TRUE) to load all 
packages dynamically. This establishes the project's dependency footprint clearly before 
implementing the installation automation logic.

This approach follows the common development pattern of first identifying what is needed, 
then adding helper functions to automate the process.

Verified by: Running the script with packages pre-installed to confirm all load successfully 
without errors.
