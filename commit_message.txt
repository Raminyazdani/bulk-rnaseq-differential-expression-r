Ramin Yazdani | bulk-rnaseq-differential-expression-r | main | feat(data): Load airway dataset and preprocess metadata

Implement data loading and preprocessing using the airway dataset from Bioconductor. 
This standard RNA-seq dataset contains gene expression measurements from airway smooth 
muscle cells treated with dexamethasone, providing a reproducible example for differential 
expression analysis.

Data processing steps:
- Loaded airway SummarizedExperiment object from Bioconductor package
- Extracted count matrix using assay() function (~63,000 genes × 8 samples)
- Extracted sample metadata using colData() function
- Cleaned treatment condition labels: renamed "trt" to "treated" for clarity
- Validated alignment between count matrix columns and metadata rows

The airway dataset is ideal for this analysis because:
- Included in Bioconductor (no external downloads required)
- Well-documented and widely used in RNA-seq tutorials
- Contains clear experimental design (4 treated vs 4 untreated samples)
- Reproducible across different computing environments

Metadata preprocessing ensures interpretable results by using descriptive condition names 
("treated"/"untreated" vs "trt"/"untrt") in downstream analysis outputs and visualizations.

Data validation confirmed that all column names in the count matrix match row names in the 
sample metadata, ensuring proper alignment for DESeq2 analysis.

Verified by: Inspecting data dimensions, metadata structure, and confirming sample/condition 
alignment with all() checks.
